            <h1>Javascript Basics</p>
            <p>Javascript is a cross-platform, object-orietned scripting language.  JavaScript is extremely popular for a variety of reasons. It is a small and lightweight language allowing maximum flexibility for developers to take it in a bunch of different directions.  JavaScript lives inside a host environment (a web browser or Node server), it can be connected to the objects of these environments to provide programmatic control over them.</p>
            <p>Variable Declaration JavaScript variables are containers for storing data values - imagine a cup you fill with coffee, the cup holds the coffee, a variable holds a value.  All JavaScript variable must be identified with unique names.  These unique names are called identifiers. var x;</p>
            <p>Variable Assignment Assignment operators assign values to JavaScript variables - our cup can now have coffee poured in it, giving our variable a value to hold.  The = assignment operator assigns a value to a variable.  var x = 10;</p>
            <p>Data Types Data types are an important concept; to be able to operate on variables you need to know the data type.  There are six data types that are JavaScript primitives: Boolean - true or false; null - null aka nothing; Number - 42 or 3.14159; String - "Coding Dojo Rocks!; Array - [1, 'Coding', 2, 'Dojo']; and Object - {first_name: 'Jane', last_name: 'Doe'}</p>
            <p>Conditionals When you write code, you want to perform different actions for differnt decisions - hitting different code blocks based on values or conditions that have been met.  You can use conditional statements in your code to accomplish this.  There are the following conditional statements; if a specified condition is true, do this code in our code block; else if to specify a new condition to test, if the first condition is false; else we execute this block of code;</p>
            <p>Loops There are many different kind of loops in every programming language, but they all essentially do the same thing: they will repeat an action some number of times.  Imagine you have to run a mile, well you run around the track four times and then you stop.  Thats a loop!</p>
            <p>Function  Functions are an encaspulation of a code block.  When we call our funtion this will run that code block.  Think of it as a list of instructions.  As an example imagine we are putting together a desk from Ikea, we open up the instruction manual and get started, first we screw the legs to the table top: next we place the table the right way up.  Done!  We finished our insturctions.  Sadly there are a tone more tables to do so lets callour function over and over and over again.</p>
